This cannot be changed once under contract. \n Once you are under contract  the matter then goes before the NCDOT Board for review. This will occur within the next 60 days. Some properties will require additional review by the NC Council of State prior to final approval. That will require an additional 30-60 days. Once we have final approval, you will receive an email with a request for final payment and a copy of the preliminary deed.\n After NCDOT receives the final payment, the Attorney General's office will take over and get the deed recorded for the property owner. This can take up to 45-60 days depending on when we have final approval.\n<br/><br/>\nWe will update you as soon as we have new information.
